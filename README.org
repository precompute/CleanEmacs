This is my personal Emacs config.  I migrated from [[https://github.com/doomemacs/][DOOM]] because updating it was a hassle owing to my extensive config.

I’ve been using Doom Emacs for four years, and I wanted my config to be a lighter version of the same.  Hence, I’ve tried to stick as close to the keybinds I’m used to.  Other parts of this config also offer Doom-like functionality.

We don’t aim this config to be minimal, but instead to be easy to understand.

- Recommended Emacs Version :: =30.0.50=

- Current Emacs commit :: =d3e650d33709c6323b9e2346a951d5eb5ff82b44=

- Recommended OS :: I use Debian Stable.  This config /might/ work on MacOS and WSL.  I don’t use either, so no guarantees.

* General Outline
** Hierarchy
- =early-init.el= :: Sets some defaults, calls =early-init-ui.el=
- =early-init-ui.el= :: Defines some faces for =modeline.el= and disables the menu bar and other stuff.
- =init.el= :: Only loads files.  Loads =elpaca-init.el= first, and other package-agnostic configuration files are called after.
- =general.el= :: Defines emacs-wide user options and enables some global minor-modes.
- =functions.el= :: Dumping ground for functions and Transients.
- =keybinds.el= :: Defines keybinds, uses =general-def=.
- =ui.el= :: Sets the theme, fonts and modifies a few faces.
- =modeline.el= :: Should be named "=headerline.el=".  Defines and =propertize= s functions that show information about the buffer, and =display= s them.  Disables the =mode-line= and instead uses the =header-line=.  Light-weight and inherits colors from the active theme.
- =loads.el= :: Loads files that aren’t tracked in this project.

** Package Management
We use [[https://github.com/progfolio/elpaca/][Elpaca]] to manage packages.  It’s very easy to set up, and works well with native-compilation.  The user does not need to intervene.

Inspired by Doom, this config uses separate module-like configuration files for every package.  This is aided by a small custom function (=elpacaLF=) that creates a config file for a package when it is installed for the first time, and loads the file.  The config is just a =use-package= block with =:elpaca= (if necessary).

Internal packages can also be configured.  They use =:elpaca nil= .

If you don’t like the package, you can remove the corresponding =elpacaLF= invocation and the package will be completely ignored on the next startup / eval.  Packages can also be installed by =eval= ing a new =elpacaLF= invocation.

All packages will be =:pin= ned shortly, to make this reproducible.

** Vim Emulation
We use =evil= for Vim Emulation.  As a Vim refugee, I’ve tried many times to get used to Emacs’ keybinds, but I keep going back to the simplicity of modal editing.

*** Keybinds
We use [[https://github.com/noctuid/general.el][general.el]] for keybinds. 

- Additional modifiers used :: *Hyper*.  Use /xmodmap/ to convert a key to *Hyper*.

** Headerline
The Headerline is mostly just a propertized default modeline.  It uses =face-remapping-alist= to change the face for the header-line depending on =(buffer-modified-p)=.  The name of the current buffer is relative to the project root (if found).  We also cache the name of the current buffer (picked up from doom-modeline’s "light" variant).  The active buffer also has two indicators on either extreme end.

* Making it your own

As of [23-06-14 22:28:53] , this config is still a work in progress but ~90% to *STABLE* status.  It lacks language-specific configuration and some ease-of-use modifications.  Those will be added in time, but if you’re a former Doom Emacs user, you can use this config as a starting point.

What you need to do:

- Clone to =~/.emacs.d=.  Alternatively, use [[https://github.com/plexus/chemacs2][Chemacs]] to enable multiple configs.
  
- Search for =~/= and =sys2= and remove / modify all local filesystem calls.

  Update [23-09-06 18:07:21] : This project is about ~95% stable.  There are no overt bugs or surprises, almost everything works well and with speed.  Language support has been added, along with many small improvements.  The emacs version has also been bumped, but no changes have been necessary.
